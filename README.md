# BudgetR

## Introduction

This is a sample application for a full-stack .Net app. It also serves as a playground for creating a budgeting and financial application.

The application is using MediatR to facilate a CRQS approach. Because the application is using Blazor Server, the mediator pattern helps to isolate the back-end processes behind a logical wall that can only be accessed through MediatR handlers.
